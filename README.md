# NMF based Movie Recommender System

This repository contains one of my projects as a data science student where I developed a Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based recomendation model for movies based on user rating data taken from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/.

<ins>The repository includes the following:</ins>
* **project_movies_recomender.ipynb** - a notebook that shows the data cleaning and pre-processing, as well as model devlopment and prediction implementation
* **web_app** - a folder that contains a movies recomendation web_app script that gives the top 10 rated movies (as a baseline recomnder) or takes 5 ratings from a user and then uses a saved NMF based model to generate 5 user-specific movie recomendations.
